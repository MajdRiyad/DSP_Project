# DSP_Project
Phase One:
Design, Implement and test an English alphabet character voice-frequency encoder which represents every English
character by a combination of three voice-band frequency components (low, middle and high).
Phase Two:
In this phase you have to design, implement and test a decoder for the system in part one, which can recover the
text string from the encoded multi-frequency signal.
